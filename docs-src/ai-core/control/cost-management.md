# Cost Management

AI agents turn every interaction into model calls, tool calls, and tokens. Without visibility, spend grows quietly: a looping agent, a verbose prompt, or an oversized model can burn through a budget before anyone notices. **Cost Management** gives you that visibility, starting at the level of each agent interaction.

## Why This Matters

- **Agent cost is hard to predict.** The same request can take one model call or ten, depending on how the agent reasons and which tools it calls.
- **Token budgets burn silently.** Without per-interaction tracking, runaway loops and oversized prompts show up only on the invoice.
- **Cost has to be weighed against quality.** Choosing a smaller model or a shorter prompt only makes sense when you can see both the cost and the evaluation results.

## Available Today — Agent Cost and Token Tracking

For **watsonx Orchestrate agents**, cost and token usage can be captured per interaction through Langfuse, alongside the traces and latency data that [Agent Ops](agent-ops.md) uses.

| Capability | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **Cost per scenario** | See tokens, cost, and pass or fail for every evaluation scenario, so expensive paths show up before production |
| **Context growth per turn** | See how cost climbs as multi-turn conversations grow, a key driver of multi-turn cost |
| **Cost patterns** | Base cost, growth rate, input-to-output token ratio, and spend wasted on failed runs |
| **Production projection** | Project cost at your expected conversation volume, with data-driven recommendations |

Tracking runs on Langfuse, either locally with watsonx Orchestrate Developer Edition or on a hosted Langfuse instance. Cost appears when Langfuse has pricing for the agent's model. Models it does not already know, including many watsonx-served models, need their pricing registered first. Latency is always recorded.

## Coming Soon — Enterprise Cost Management

- **Allocation** of AI spend by team, use case, or model.
- **Budgets and alerts** before costs become unmanageable.
- **Optimization** — identifying waste and cost per outcome across AI workloads.

## Bob Skills

The [Bob skill for Agent Ops](https://github.com/ibm-self-serve-assets/building-blocks/tree/main/ibm-bob/skills/agent-ops) includes Langfuse cost analysis. Ask Bob, for example, *"How do I set up Langfuse so I can see cost per scenario?"*
